  "description": "**Reverse Tetris** is a browser-based puzzle game that flips the logic of classic Tetris. Instead of blocks falling from the top, they rise from the bottom. The goal remains the same: clear lines. This project was entirely developed by a solo developer — from design and code to core functionality — with sound effects sourced from [TETRIO+](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus/) and UI inspired by [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io).",
